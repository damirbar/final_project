Welcome to WizeStream's SCRUM page.

Rules:

* If your name is associated to a "Grab" task -> it's yours to grab.
* If you find yourself suitable for a "Grab" task -> grab it!
* Try not to grab more than one task simultaneously.
* If you grab a task, you cut it, paste it under "On progress" and put your name on it.
* If you've finished a task, you cut it and paste it under "Done".

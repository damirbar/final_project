    \section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Abstract}

    The educational system, up until the 20th century, hasn't evolved much. By the 00' the system improved massively by using a wide range of different services and applications to ease the learning experience, such as:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item WhatsApp, Facebook - Forum/messaging tools for group chatting,
        messy file sharing system and QA.
        \item Google Drive, Dropbox - Generic not student-oriented cloud system.
        Old communication system between students and lecturers, an exercise
        submission feature and QA option.
        \item Gool - Non-free on-demand video courses.
        \item Kahoot - Interactive student teacher app.
        \item Institution based feedback.
    \end{itemize}
    wizeUp is a reality which combines
    and enhances these features and more in to one easy-to-use user-friendly
    platform.



    \subsection{Related Work}


    This chapter surveys previous student-teacher platforms. Our project
    isn't about reinventing the wheel, but to suggest a decent way to bind
    between existing products and to innovate with our live streaming.
    We'll demonstrate for each field how it exists, but suffers lack of
    functionality and accessibility for students/teachers.

    \newcounter{numberedCntBD}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Clouds}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    As we all know, clouds exist for a very long time. There are clouds
    owned by the strongest companies in the world. Our project isn't meant
    to compete with any of those, but to optimize the student/teacher
    approach to a study-relevant cloud. Our application will identify the
    file's extension, decide whether it's a document, a summary or a
    previous test, and will sort it so the user will enjoy surfing our
    cloud, instead of getting lost in it.



    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Text-Message systems}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    There are lots of text-messaging systems, such as WhatsApp, Telegram,
    etc. Our platform will suggest a basic messaging system.





    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{GPA Calculator}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    During our studies, we came across several GPA calculators. One of them
    was in our university's mobile application and the other was an external
    mobile application. The problem with our university's application was
    the fact that it was unmodifiable. We couldn't calculate our "\,what
    ifs" or to check whether we should retake a certain course. The problem
    with the external application was the fact that it's external. It forced
    us to download a third-party application to our mobile phones.



    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Tracking course progress}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    Our product provides students with a course progress tracking feature,
    based on taking quizzes, submitting assignments and reading papers. Our
    team has yet to encounter such a feature.



    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Learning management system}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    There are many learning management systems. The one which the project's
    team used is Moodle \cite{moodle,usingmoodle}. Moodle suggest a lot, but as you will witness, we suggest more.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Live Stream Video}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    This is where we truly innovate. Using the product of our project, you
    will be able to be at the lecture, even if you are absent from the
    class. You can send/receive messages from other students from the same
    lecture group during the lecture. You can ask the group questions and
    answer questions yourself.



    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Live Feedback}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    Everyone benefits from the Live Feedback. Students which haven't quite
    gotten the last topic learned in class, will no longer desperately raise
    their hands, but post it right into our Live Feedback system in real
    time. If most of the students felt the same way, the teacher might want
    to consider it. If a student did understand, he can tell the application
    that he did understand and by so to balance the "\,wizeScale".



    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntBD}
        \item \textbf{\underline{Statistical Gathering}}
        \setcounter{numberedCntBD}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    The product of this project will independently gather statistical
    information regarding students' satisfaction and students' progress.
    This way the educational institution will be able to monitor its
    employees and improve.

    \subsection{Overview}
    wizeUp is a tool to help students get better at their studies and to
    help teachers have a better perspective on their class. wizeUp
    allows teachers to upload relevant files, answer students' questions and
    improve their teaching methods using live feedback. With
    wizeUp students can communicate with their classmates, share files
    and enjoy live video streaming, providing the option of live feedback.
    \newline
    wizeUp is the best way to gather statistical information for the use
    of both parties, students and teachers, as well as any department
    chosen. wizeUp will drive both sides, students and teachers, to
    thrive using a scoring system. wizeUp will make teaching and
    learning easier, faster and better.
